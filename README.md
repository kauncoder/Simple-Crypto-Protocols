# Simple-Crypto-Protocols
A repository of easy to understand code for some of the more used and famous cryptographic protocols.
The main inspiration for this was (is?) the lack of content to bridge the gap between theory and practical cryptography.
This is therefore strictly meant to be material for self-study and not for use in coding an industrial application (and preferably, even for a demo for some school project :P)
Incidentally, this also happens to be a good showcase for Go langauge and its applications in cryptography.
I hope this helps people get more involved in the beautiful beautiful field of cryptography.
